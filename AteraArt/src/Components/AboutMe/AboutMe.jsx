                Hi there! I'm Ilhame After growing up in Mechelen, studying Law
                in Brussels, and pursuing photography courses in Antwerp, I now
                live in Heist-op-den-Berg with my first love and since 2019, my
                husband!. I enjoy coffee on a cozy terrace, whether it's with
                friends or by myself. Traveling brings me happiness. I thrive on
                meeting new people and find peace during a walk in a park or
                even a busy shopping street . The passion I have for my work is
                big, so much so that I decided to put away my Law degree and
                fully dedicate myself to my passion, which is capturing love. I
                simply can't imagine doing anything else. My goal is to create
                vibrant, touching, and unique images. For me, photography means
                capturing fleeting moments as well as the reality of a dream.
                Together with Fouad, we give our all to provide our couples with
                a unique experience!
